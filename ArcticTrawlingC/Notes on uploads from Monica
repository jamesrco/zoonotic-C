Handing over the files to Gael

These are the files and R code I developed to evaluate trawling carbon remineralization from the area of melting ice. I had partially written up some methods in a word document and made some powerpoint schematics. 
I also have a short presentation with preliminary results. The figures will likely change, but in the event that they stay the same, feel free to use them.

The crux of my approach was to create a loop of carbon stock disturbance (and fraction of subsequent remineralization), carbon stock resettling after disturbance, and carbon replenishment from natural sedimentation.
I pulled equations and conservative rates from the Sala update paper but they could probably be updated still. There was a lot of debate about the value of k spanning orders of magnitude.

For initial carbon stock, I combined a map from Atwood with another map to fill the hole at the pole. They don't blend well. I also attempted some jackknifing with the carbon core dataset that Alex Waller had pulled together, but more information on environmental conditions was needed to make a proper carbon stocks model.
Trawling activity was predicted by using the Fauchauld et al. 2021 model, which predicted activity based on fish biomass correlations with temperature and ice cover. I swapped out the ice cover and SST layers over time.
