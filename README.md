**Note:** Please visit [this repository](https://github.com/jamesrco/global-trawling-CO2) for code and data to support Collins, J. R., K. M. Kleisner, R. M. Fujita, and R. E. Boenish (2025). Ocean depth, circulation and biogeochemistry drive geographic disparities in potential emissions from benthic trawling. In revision for *PLOS Climate*.

### Raw, unmodified data and files

#### Arctic benthic trawling and seabed disturbance analysis 

* Spatial data for the Arctic benthic trawling and seabed disturbance analysis, including future biomass and ice extent simulations from various models, can be found in [data/arctic_trawling/spatial_inputs](data/arctic_trawling/spatial_inputs). These were generated by [@mmoritsch](https://github.com/mmoritsch). The [README file](data/arctic_trawling/spatial_inputs/README.txt) in this folder contains some notes about each dataset. More details on data provenence will be posted here as the project progresses.

* The folder [data/arctic_trawling/catch_data](data/arctic_trawling/catch_data) contains a file with annual average catch data (2000-2016) for bottom-trawled species managed under the Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission and North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization Regional Fisheries Management Organizations.

### Scripts

#### Shell scripts for AWS provisioning

* The shell scripts in [aws_provisioning](aws_provisioning) are designed to be run in order on an AWS Ubuntu instance, to configure the remote virtual machine for running the various R scripts in this repository. They could be used to provision an Ubuntu instance to work generally with geospatial data in R. The fourth script ([04_ubuntu_mailnotify.sh](aws_provisioning/04_ubuntu_mailnotify.sh)) and accompanying text file in the "ssmtp" folder are not critical, but configure the remote machine to send simple email alerts (e.g., notification when a task is completed) to a supplied email address. *Note that user (if not me) will have to supply an email address and password. For obvious reasons, I removed the password from the file before I committed it.* 

#### Zoogeochemical carbon fluxes

* The script [OpenOceanNCSfigs.R](OpenOceanNCSfigs.R) was used to generate the figures appearing in Collins et al., "The biogeochemistry of natural climate solutions based on fish, fisheries, and marine mammals: A review of current evidence, research needs, and critical assessment of readiness," a review for the journal *Global Biogeochemical Cycles*

#### Global benthic trawling emissions analysis

* Items have been moved to [this repository](https://github.com/jamesrco/global-trawling-CO2).

### Outputs and derived data

#### "Zoogeochemical"" carbon fluxes

* The .csv file [Open_ocean_NCS_C_data.csv](data/Open_ocean_NCS_C_data.csv) contains the input data collected from the literature for the figures in the Collins et al. review for *Global Biogeochemical Cycles*. The references from which the various flux and reservoir estimates were obtained are given in the file. The data in the .csv file, as well as several dozen additional values from the literature, are included in Table 2 in the manuscript.
