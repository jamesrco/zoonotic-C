# zoonotic-C
Calculations and figures to support Collins et al. review (in prep) of zoogeochemical carbon fluxes in the ocean, an analysis of the possible climate impacts from new benthic trawling in the emerging Arctic, and possible a comment on the 2021 Sala et al. *Nature* paper.

### Raw, unmodified data and files

#### Benthic trawling reanalysis

* The files in [data/global_trawling/raw/sala_et_al_2021](data/global_trawling/raw/sala_et_al_2021) are from [Sala et al., 2021. Protecting the global ocean for biodiversity, food and climate. *Nature* **592**, 397â€“402](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03371-z). Data files were retrieved from https://doi.org/10.25349/D9N89M on June 6, 2022. Resolution of the CO2 flux dataset (in [co2_efflux.tif]((data/global_trawling/raw/sala_et_al_2021/co2_efflux.tif)) is 1 km<sup>2</sup>. Resolution of both of the other two trawling-related datasets ([bottom_trawling_Ia.tif](data/global_trawling/raw/sala_et_al_2021/bottom_trawling_Ia.tif) and [carbon_ranking.tif](data/global_trawling/raw/sala_et_al_2021/carbon_ranking.tif) is 50 km<sup>2</sup>.)

* The files "fseq_OCIM2_48L.mat" and "fseq_OCIM2_48L.nc" in [data/global_trawling/raw/siegel_et_al_2021_v2](data/global_trawling/raw/siegel_et_al_2021_v2) are from [Siegel et al., 2021. Assessing the sequestration time scales of some ocean-based carbon dioxide reduction strategies. *Environ. Res. Lett.* **16** 104003](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0be0#erlac0be0s5). The files contain the same data in MATLAB and NetCDF formats and were retrieved from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.15228690.v2 on June 6, 2022. Per the published paper, model resolution is 2 degrees with 48 vertical levels. **Update: These files are not stored on GitHub due to size. User replicating this analysis will have to download the datasets from the figshare link and then move the files to the correct location.**

* The file "plot_sequestration_fraction.m" in [data/global_trawling/raw/siegel_et_al_2021_v2](data/global_trawling/raw/siegel_et_al_2021_v2) is the original, unmodified MATLAB script that Siegel et al. provided along with the data files containing the sequestration fractions. A modified version of this file, [global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m](global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m), was used to pull out the [necessary benthic sequestration fractions](data/global_trawling/derived/benthic_seqfractions) for the analysis using the [three R scripts in global_trawling](global_trawling/).

### Scripts

#### Shell scripts for AWS provisioning

* The shell scripts in [aws_provisioning](aws_provisioning) are designed to be run in order on an AWS Ubuntu instance, to configure the remote virtual machine for running the various R scripts in this repository. They could be used to provision an Ubuntu instance to work generally with geospatial data in R. The fourth script ([04_ubuntu_mailnotify.sh](aws_provisioning/04_ubuntu_mailnotify.sh)) and accompanying text file in the "ssmtp" folder are not critical, but configure the remote machine to send simple email alerts (e.g., notification when a task is completed) to a supplied email address.

#### Benthic trawling reanalysis

* The R scripts [global_trawling/01_ConstrainCO2Flux_IO.R](global_trawling/01_ConstrainCO2Flux_IO.R), [global_trawling/02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R](global_trawling/02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R), and [global_trawling/03b_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux_extended.R](global_trawling/03b_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux_extended.R) are the workhorse scripts for the benthic trawling reanalysis, along with [global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m](global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m). They should be run in order, with the note that some of the `library()` calls and setting of working directory are repetitive. The operations in  [global_trawling/02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R](global_trawling/02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R) are the most intensive and this is the script that really required the use of AWS. [global_trawling/03a_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux.R](global_trawling/03a_ConstrainCO2Flux_adjFlux.R) is an earlier version of the third script, with a short-cut that in the end didn't really make a big impact. But the "b" version of the script doesn't take any shortcuts, so that's the one used I used for the final analysis.

### Outputs and derived data

#### Benthic trawling reanalysis

* The files in [data/global_trawling/derived/benthic_seqfractions](data/global_trawling/derived/benthic_seqfractions) are sequestration fractions for bottom depths for the indicated year(s) plus necessary metadata, pulled from the [original Siegel et al. model output](data/global_trawling/raw/siegel_et_al_2021_v2) using the script [global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m](global_trawling/gen_fracs_to_constrain_trawlCO2.m). Individual .csv files contain the fractions for just the year indicated in the file name, while [fseq_bottom_multyears.mat](data/global_trawling/derived/benthic_seqfractions/fseq_bottom_multyears.mat) is a 3-D MATLAB array containing the fractions for years 1-200 in one-year increments, plus years 300-1000 in 100-year increments. [benthic_years.csv](data/global_trawling/derived/benthic_seqfractions/benthic_years.csv) is a list of the years represented in this 3-D array, corresponding to the 3rd dimension of the array.

* The files in [data/global_trawling/derived/output](data/global_trawling/derived/output) represent the outputs. Specifically:

    + [coord.matches.RData](data/global_trawling/derived/output/coord.matches.RData) is a **large** (ca. 1.5 GB; stored using GitHub's Git LFS implementation) R data object containing the indices of the geographically closest data points in the two source datasets, generated using [02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R](global_trawling/02_ConstrainCO2Flux_coordMatch.R).
    
    + [Sala_et_al_trawlTiming_results.csv](data/global_trawling/derived/sala_et_al_2021_model/Sala_et_al_trawlTiming_results.csv) contains the "timing" output from the sediment disturbance model presented in the Sala et al. paper (remineralization of 1.47 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> in the "first" year after commencement of trawling, declining to a steady rate of 0.58 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> at year 10 and beyond); this .csv file captures the values in the object `results` that is produced beginning on line 119 in [this script](https://github.com/emlab-ucsb/ocean-conservation-priorities/blob/master/ancillary_analyses/timing_of_trawling_impacts.Rmd).
    
    + [adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_yr.csv](data/global_trawling/derived/output/adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_yr.csv) contains adjusted estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere in a given year *n* following a one-time, 1.47 Pg remineralization of CO<sub>2</sub> from sediment to bottom water in year 0 (as assumed by Sala et al.). For example, the results indicate that, after 1000 years, 0.49 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> of the 1.47 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> remineralized from carbon in sediment in year 0 will have reached the atmosphere. The quantity reaching the atmosphere is dramatically smaller for shorter time horizons. After just 100 years, only 0.046 Pg of the remineralized CO<sub>2</sub> (about 3%) will have reached the atmosphere. 
    
    + [adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_cumulative.csv](data/global_trawling/derived/output/adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_cumulative.csv) contains cumulative emissions estimates of CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere based on the pattern of trawling-related sediment disturbance posited by Sala et al. (remineralization of 1.47 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> in the "first" year after commencement of trawling, declining to a steady rate of 0.58 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> yr<sup>-1</sup> at year 10 and beyond). For example, the analysis shows that after 100 years, a *cumulative* 1.27 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> will have been emitted to the atmosphere if trawling indeed remineralizes carbon in sediments according to the hypothesized pattern, beginning at year 0. This cumulative 1.27 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> is less than the 1.47 Pg CO<sub>2</sub> Sala et al. suggested could be emitted in the first year of activity alone.![Figure 1. Cumulative CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to atmosphere for the indicated year, given a continuous pattern of trawling-related sediment disturbance beginning in year 0 according to the model described in Sala et al. (2021). Generated using the results in [adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_cumulative.csv](data/global_trawling/derived/output/adjCO2efflux_PgCO2_cumulative.csv).](img_output/CumulativePgCO2_vs_year.png)
